[User should upload 5-7 original Ana sticker images here]

## Critical Instructions
These images show Ana's EXACT appearance. Every generation must match:
- ✓ Her facial features (eye shape/size, nose, lips, face shape)
- ✓ Her skin tone (#8B6F47 to #A67C52)
- ✓ The soft painterly art style
- ✓ Natural human proportions

DO NOT change these core elements.
ONLY change: hair style, outfit, expression, pose, setting, text

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Making eyes too large or Disney-style
- ❌ Adding excessive gloss or shine
- ❌ Creating 3D-rendered or hyper-realistic look
- ❌ Lightening skin tone or making it orange
- ❌ Over-detailing hair or features

## Correct Approach
- ✓ Match the soft, warm, painterly quality
- ✓ Keep eyes natural and proportional
- ✓ Maintain rich medium-brown skin tone
- ✓ Use matte finish with gentle shading
- ✓ Focus on emotion and character over technical detail
